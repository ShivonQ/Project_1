This Wiki System is The first attempt of a website I have always wanted to make for housing the massive amount of information on my Dungeons and Dragons world; Archaevas.  

At the creation of this Site, I had not yet learned a lot of crucial skills for Web-Development, such as Database Integration and had to make do with what skills I did have.

A few features that will be in it are as follows:

*Custom Google Map, complete with marked locations for major cities
    (*)Google Maps Image Tiles Served Locally at the moment.
    (*)Mini Map for local view

*Interactive Calendar
    (*)Hard Coded Days/Months, Each day will be associated to a "day" json object that stores relevant data
    (*)JS enabled calendar that displays more info in little hover window, links to places/people
    (*)JS enabled way of adding information to a days occurrences

*Lots of good looking pages with global, local and bootstrap css elements.

Map Page:
   Almost works.
   Google API does not allow the images to be on a local device for security reasons.

Calendar Page:
  Hard Coded lunar cycle and days and months.
  Need to create JS to dynamicly bring up info box for a day on a hovering mouse, click a day and box stays til closed.

 Main Page:
   Figuring out how to change color of bootstrap navbar, being uncooperative.
   Adding some links to it to the other two pages.
   Need to figure out how to extend the navbar, or just copy it. (Javascript constructor)
   
   
 This project is currently Hosted by github at https://shivonq.github.io/index.html
 and stores 'changed' data in your cookies. It was the only way I could figure how to do that, at the time not having learned how to use MongoDB in conjuction with Web Projects.
